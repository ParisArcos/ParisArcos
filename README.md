### Abaut me:
 I am  from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ,  Canary Islands ☀️, Spain.

 During my professional life I've played many roles, being IT my main occupation since 2008
 and more specifically programming since 2019.

 If I had to highlight something about my Soft Skills, it would be commitment, teamwork and
 the ability to work under pressure, qualities that I've trained during my more than ten years of
 service in the army.

 All this has to do with my professional ethic, which includes promoting a good working
 environment and mutual support when needed.
